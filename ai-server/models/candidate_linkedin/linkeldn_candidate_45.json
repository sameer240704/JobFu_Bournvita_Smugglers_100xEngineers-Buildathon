  "about": "Hey there! I’m Sujal Choudhari—a third-year IT student at DJSCE, Mumbai, and a coding enthusiast who’s been tinkering with tech for over five years. I live at the intersection of creativity and code, building projects that solve problems, spark joy, and push boundaries. Here’s what I’ve been up to:🌟 I’ve created over 100 open-source projects on GitHub—my playground—featuring work like Neptune.js (a game engine born from a wild 80kb challenge) and Coda, where I’ve earned stars, forks, and a ton of fun collaborating with the dev community.📦 I’ve shipped packages on pub.dev, npmjs.com, and PyPI—little gifts to developers everywhere, making their lives easier one line of code at a time.📚 I’ve authored books on Amazon and Gumroad (some freebies too!), spilling my insights to inspire and empower the next wave of programmers.🏆 I’m a hackathon hustler—clinching Smart India Hackathon (twice!) and winning GenAI and AR/VR challenges, thriving on turning ideas into victories under pressure.I’m fluent in Python, C++, TypeScript, and more—think of me as a tech Swiss Army knife, equally at home crafting sleek web apps with React or immersive games in Unity. What drives me? A relentless curiosity, a knack for problem-solving, and a passion for creating stuff that matters.I’m always up for a challenge and eager to team up with folks who dream big. If you’re looking for a versatile developer who brings energy, skill, and a fresh perspective, let’s chat—I’d love to help turn your vision into reality! 🚀P.S. Check out my GitHub or sujal.xyz for a peek at what I’m building next! 👀",
