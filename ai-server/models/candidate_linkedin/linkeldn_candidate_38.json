  "about": "I began my career working with Software Testing, my first job within the IT industry. This opportunity opened the door to my beginning at IBM where I worked with Oracle Database development and analysis, in this case specifically my first contact with coding and a feeling that varies between discoveries, learning, frustration, expectation and hours of hard work in solving errors. Despite the hard work invested in addressing these challenges, the satisfaction derived from resolving problems and meeting expectations cannot be overlooked. I believe every Developer identifies with these moments in their career, forming a deep passion for what we do.An informal conversation with a childhood friend, who happens to be an excellent Developer, sparked my interest in Web development. This led me to enroll in a bootcamp, an experience that felt like love at first sight! Over the years, my journey in Web development has continued, with a daily commitment to progress and staying updated on the latest technologies in the market.In summary, I am a Software Developer/Analyst with a successful 8+ years of experience.Please refer to my resume for details of my previous experience and skill set.Interested in checking the code I have worked?
