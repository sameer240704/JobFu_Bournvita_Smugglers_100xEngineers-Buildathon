      "about": "I began my career working with Software Testing, my first job within the IT industry. This opportunity opened the door to my beginning at IBM where I worked with Oracle Database development and analysis, in this case specifically my first contact with coding and a feeling that varies between discoveries, learning, frustration, expectation and hours of hard work in solving errors. Despite the hard work invested in addressing these challenges, the satisfaction derived from resolving problems and meeting expectations cannot be overlooked. I believe every Developer identifies with these moments in their career, forming a deep passion for what we do.An informal conversation with a childhood friend, who happens to be an excellent Developer, sparked my interest in Web development. This led me to enroll in a bootcamp, an experience that felt like love at first sight! Over the years, my journey in Web development has continued, with a daily commitment to progress and staying updated on the latest technologies in the market.In summary, I am a Software Developer/Analyst with a successful 8+ years of experience.Please refer to my resume for details of my previous experience and skill set.Interested in checking the code I have worked?

      "about": "Hey there! I’m Sujal Choudhari—a third-year IT student at DJSCE, Mumbai, and a coding enthusiast who’s been tinkering with tech for over five years. I live at the intersection of creativity and code, building projects that solve problems, spark joy, and push boundaries. Here’s what I’ve been up to:🌟 I’ve created over 100 open-source projects on GitHub—my playground—featuring work like Neptune.js (a game engine born from a wild 80kb challenge) and Coda, where I’ve earned stars, forks, and a ton of fun collaborating with the dev community.📦 I’ve shipped packages on pub.dev, npmjs.com, and PyPI—little gifts to developers everywhere, making their lives easier one line of code at a time.📚 I’ve authored books on Amazon and Gumroad (some freebies too!), spilling my insights to inspire and empower the next wave of programmers.🏆 I’m a hackathon hustler—clinching Smart India Hackathon (twice!) and winning GenAI and AR/VR challenges, thriving on turning ideas into victories under pressure.I’m fluent in Python, C++, TypeScript, and more—think of me as a tech Swiss Army knife, equally at home crafting sleek web apps with React or immersive games in Unity. What drives me? A relentless curiosity, a knack for problem-solving, and a passion for creating stuff that matters.I’m always up for a challenge and eager to team up with folks who dream big. If you’re looking for a versatile developer who brings energy, skill, and a fresh perspective, let’s chat—I’d love to help turn your vision into reality! 🚀P.S. Check out my GitHub or sujal.xyz for a peek at what I’m building next! 👀",
